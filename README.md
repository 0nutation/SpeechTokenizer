## Introduction
SpeechTokenizer is a unified speech tokenizer for speech large language models. SpeechTokenizer adopts the Encoder-Decoder architecture with residual vector quantization (RVQ). Unifying semantic and acoustic tokens, SpeechTokenizer disentangles different aspects of speech information hierarchically across different RVQ layers. Leveraging SpeechTokenizer, we construct a Unified Speech Language Model (USLM).
